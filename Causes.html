          <img src="Peer pressure.png" alt="Peer Pressure" width="300"><br>
          <li><strong>Peer Pressure:</strong> Teenagers and students may feel pushed to join in on bullying to be accepted by a certain group or to gain popularity, especially in school or social circles.</li><br>
          <img src="Jealousy.png" alt="Jealousy" width="300"><br>
          <li><strong>Jealousy and Envy:</strong> Some people bully others online because they are jealous of their looks, lifestyle, success, relationships, or attention they receive on social media.</li><br>
          <img src="Revenge.png" alt="Revenge" width="300"><br> 
          <li><strong>Revenge or Retaliation:</strong> Cyberbullying is sometimes a form of payback. A person who feels hurt, excluded, or offended may try to "get even" by attacking someone online.</li><br>
          <img src="Anonymity.png" alt="Anonymity" width="300"><br>
          <li><strong>Anonymity on the Internet:</strong> The internet allows users to hide their identity, making it easier for them to bully others without facing consequences. They feel safe behind a screen.</li><br>
          <img src="Boredom.png" alt="Boredom" width="300"><br>
          <li><strong>Boredom or Lack of Purpose:</strong> Some people cyberbully because they’re bored or want attention. They don’t think about how their actions affect others and treat it like a joke or game.</li><br>
          <img src="Lack of empathy.png" alt="Lack of Empathy" width="300"><br>
          <li><strong>Lack of Empathy or Awareness:</strong> Many bullies don’t understand the pain they’re causing. They may never see the victim’s reaction, so they don’t realize the emotional damage being done.</li><br>
          <img src="Personal issues.png" alt="Personal issues" width="300"><br>
          <li><strong>Home or Personal Issues:</strong> Sometimes, people who are experiencing stress, abuse, or problems at home may release their anger or frustration by bullying others online.</li>
